## Executive Summary
This report presents an in-depth analysis of traffic crash patterns in the City of Metropolis between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2025. Commissioned by the Mayor, the study leverages a decade of crash data to uncover key trends, identify primary causes of severe accidents, and provide actionable insights to support safety initiatives, policy decisions, and budget allocations for the upcoming fiscal year.

## Business Context
Traffic safety is a major concern for Metropolis, with crashes causing injuries, fatalities, property damage, and economic losses. City leaders need clear, data-based insights to understand where and why crashes occur so they can allocate resources wisely, improve enforcement, and invest in safer infrastructure. This project provides those insights by turning raw crash data into a practical decision-making tool.

## Objectives

- Identify key trends in traffic crashes over the 10-year period (2016–2025).
- Analyze the main causes and crash types that lead to severe outcomes.
- Provide actionable insights to guide safety campaigns, police enforcement, and infrastructure investments.
- Demonstrate the use of Power BI for data cleaning, modeling, DAX, and visualization.

 ## Data Overview
The analysis is based on the dataset traffic_accidents.csv, which contains detailed records of traffic crashes in Metropolis from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2025. Each record captures crash characteristics, environmental conditions, and resulting outcomes.
